# Heart Disease Prediction using Unsupervised Approach üíñ
## Welcome to the Heart Disease Prediction project repository!In this project, we explore the application of unsupervised learning techniques, particularly the K-means algorithm, to predict heart disease. ü©∫‚ù§Ô∏è
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various medical attributes. Leveraging machine learning techniques, we analyze a comprehensive dataset to develop predictive models that can assist healthcare professionals in early detection and intervention.
## About
Heart disease is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Early detection plays a crucial role in improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality rates. The goal of this project is to develop accurate prediction models using machine learning algorithms, providing a valuable tool for healthcare providers in risk assessment and preventive care strategies.
## Features
* Predictive Models: Explore different machine learning algorithms used for heart disease prediction.
* Data Analysis: Dive into comprehensive data analysis to understand the factors influencing heart disease.
* Evaluation Metrics: Assess model performance using relevant evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Interactive Interface (Optional): Provide an optional feature if you have implemented an interactive interface for users to input their data and get predictions.
